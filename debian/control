Description: lightweight PDF viewer and toolkit written in portable C
 The renderer in MuPDF is tailored for high quality anti-aliased
 graphics. It renders text with metrics and spacing accurate to within
 fractions of a pixel for the highest fidelity in reproducing the look
 of a printed page on screen.
 .
 MuPDF has a small footprint. A binary that includes the standard
 Roman fonts is only one megabyte. A build with full CJK support
 (including an Asian font) is approximately five megabytes.
 .
 MuPDF has support for all non-interactive PDF 1.7 features, and the
 toolkit provides a simple API for accessing the internal structures
 of the PDF document. Example code for navigating interactive links
 and bookmarks, encrypting PDF files, extracting fonts, images, and
 searchable text, and rendering pages to image files is provided.
