<p>
The clean command pretty prints and rewrites the syntax of a PDF file.
It can be used to repair broken files, expand compressed streams,
filter out a range of pages, etc.

<pre>
mutool clean [options] input.pdf [output.pdf] [pages]
</pre>

<p>
If no output file is specified, it will write the cleaned PDF to
"out.pdf" in the current directory.

<dl>
<dt> -p password
<dd> Use the specified password if the file is encrypted.

<dt> -g
<dd> Garbage collect objects that have no references from other
objects.  Give the option twice to renumber all objects and
compact the cross reference table.  Give it three times to merge
and reuse duplicate objects.

<dt> -s
<dd> Rewrite content streams.

<dt> -d
<dd> Decompress streams. This will make the output file larger, but
provides easy access for reading and editing the contents with a
text editor.

<dt> -l
<dd> Linearize output. Create a "Web Optimized" output file.

<dt> -i
<dd> Toggle decompression of image streams. Use in conjunction with
-d to leave images compressed.

<dt> -f
<dd> Toggle decompression of font streams. Use in conjunction with -d
to leave fonts compressed.

<dt> -a
<dd> ASCII Hex encode binary streams. Use in conjunction with -d and
-i or -f to ensure that although the images and/or fonts are
compressed, the resulting file can still be viewed and edited
with a text editor.

<dt> -z
<dd> Deflate uncompressed streams.  If combined with -d, any
decompressed streams will be recompressed.  If combined with -a,
the streams will also be hex encoded after compression.

<dt> pages
<dd> Comma separated list of page numbers and ranges to include.
