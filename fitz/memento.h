/* Memento: A library to aid debugging of memory leaks/heap corruption.
 *
 * Usage:
 *    First, build your project with MEMENTO defined, and include this
 *    header file wherever you use malloc, realloc or free.
 *    This header file will use macros to point malloc, realloc and free to
 *    point to Memento_malloc, Memento_realloc, Memento_free.
 *
 *    Run your program, and all mallocs/frees/reallocs should be redirected
 *    through here. When the program exits, you will get a list of all the
 *    leaked blocks, together with some helpful statistics. You can get the
 *    same list of allocated blocks at any point during program execution by
 *    calling Memento_listBlocks();
 *
 *    Every call to malloc/free/realloc counts as an 'allocation event'.
 *    On each event Memento increments a counter. Every block is tagged with
 *    the current counter on allocation. Every so often during program
 *    execution, the heap is checked for consistency. By default this happens
 *    every 1024 events. This can be changed at runtime by using
 *    Memento_setParanoia(int level). 0 turns off such checking, 1 sets
 *    checking to happen on every event, any other number n sets checking to
 *    happen once every n events.
 *
 *    Memento keeps blocks around for a while after they have been freed, and
 *    checks them as part of these heap checks to see if they have been
 *    written to (or are freed twice etc).
 *
 *    A given heap block can be checked for consistency (it's 'pre' and
 *    'post' guard blocks are checked to see if they have been written to)
 *    by calling Memento_checkBlock(void *blockAddress);
 *
 *    A check of all the memory can be triggered by calling Memento_check();
 *    (or Memento_checkAllMemory(); if you'd like it to be quieter).
 *
 *    A good place to breakpoint is Memento_breakpoint, as this will then
 *    trigger your debugger if an error is detected. This is done
 *    automatically for debug windows builds.
 *
 *    If a block is found to be corrupt, information will be printed to the
 *    console, including the address of the block, the size of the block,
 *    the type of corruption, the number of the block and the event on which
 *    it last passed a check for correctness.
 *
 *    If you rerun, and call Memento_paranoidAt(int event); with this number
 *    the the code will wait until it reaches that event and then start
 *    checking the heap after every allocation event. Assuming it is a
 *    deterministic failure, you should then find out where in your program
 *    the error is occurring (between event x-1 and event x).
 *
 *    Then you can rerun the program again, and call
 *    Memento_breakAt(int event); and the program will call
 *    Memento_Breakpoint() when event x is reached, enabling you to step
 *    through.
 *
 *    Memento_find(address) will tell you what block (if any) the given
 *    address is in.
 *
 * An example:
 *    Suppose we have a gs invocation that crashes with memory corruption.
 *     * Build with -DMEMENTO.
 *     * In your debugger put breakpoints on Memento_inited and
 *       Memento_Breakpoint.
 *     * Run the program. It will stop in Memento_inited.
 *     * Execute Memento_setParanoia(1);  (In VS use Ctrl-Alt-Q). (Note #1)
 *     * Continue execution.
 *     * It will detect the memory corruption on the next allocation event
 *       after it happens, and stop in Memento_breakpoint. The console should
 *       show something like:
 *
 *       Freed blocks:
 *         0x172e610(size=288,num=1415) index 256 (0x172e710) onwards corrupted
 *           Block last checked OK at allocation 1457. Now 1458.
 *
 *     * This means that the block became corrupted between allocation 1457
 *       and 1458 - so if we rerun and stop the program at 1457, we can then
 *       step through, possibly with a data breakpoint at 0x172e710 and see
 *       when it occurs.
 *     * So restart the program from the beginning. When we hit Memento_inited
 *       execute Memento_breakAt(1457); (and maybe Memento_setParanoia(1), or
 *       Memento_setParanoidAt(1457))
 *     * Continue execution until we hit Memento_breakpoint.
 *     * Now you can step through and watch the memory corruption happen.
 *
 *    Note #1: Using Memento_setParanoia(1) can cause your program to run
 *    very slowly. You may instead choose to use Memento_setParanoia(100)
 *    (or some other figure). This will only exhaustively check memory on
 *    every 100th allocation event. This trades speed for the size of the
 *    average allocation event range in which detection of memory corruption
 *    occurs. You may (for example) choose to run once checking every 100
 *    allocations and discover that the corruption happens between events
 *    X and X+100. You can then rerun using Memento_paranoidAt(X), and
 *    it'll only start exhaustively checking when it reaches X.
 *
 * More than one memory allocator?
 *
 *    If you have more than one memory allocator in the system (like for
 *    instance the ghostscript chunk allocator, that builds on top of the
 *    standard malloc and returns chunks itself), then there are some things
 *    to note:
 *
 *    * If the secondary allocator gets its underlying blocks from calling
 *      malloc, then those will be checked by Memento, but 'subblocks' that
 *      are returned to the secondary allocator will not. There is currently
 *      no way to fix this other than trying to bypass the secondary
 *      allocator. One way I have found to do this with the chunk allocator
 *      is to tweak its idea of a 'large block' so that it puts every
 *      allocation in its own chunk. Clearly this negates the point of having
 *      a secondary allocator, and is therefore not recommended for general
 *      use.
 *
 *    * Again, if the secondary allocator gets its underlying blocks from
 *      calling malloc (and hence Memento) leak detection should still work
 *      (but whole blocks will be detected rather than subblocks).
 *
 *    * If on every allocation attempt the secondary allocator calls into
 *      Memento_failThisEvent(), and fails the allocation if it returns true
 *      then more useful features can be used; firstly memory squeezing will
 *      work, and secondly, Memento will have a "finer grained" paranoia
 *      available to it.
