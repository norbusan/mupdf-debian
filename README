ABOUT

MuPDF is a lightweight PDF and XPS viewer and parser/rendering library.

The renderer in MuPDF is tailored for high quality anti-aliased graphics. It
renders text with metrics and spacing accurate to within fractions of a pixel
for the highest fidelity in reproducing the look of a printed page on screen.

MuPDF is also small, fast, and yet complete. We support PDF 1.7 with
transparency, encryption, hyperlinks, annotations, search and many other bells
and whistles. MuPDF can also read XPS documents (OpenXPS / ECMA-388).

We don't support interactive features such as form filling, javascript and
transitions. MuPDF is written modularly, so such features can be added on by
integrators if they so desire.

COMPILING

If you are compiling from source you will need several third party libraries:
freetype2, jbig2dec, libjpeg, openjpeg, and zlib. We have prepared a package
(mupdf-thirdparty.zip) that you can unzip in the mupdf source tree if you don't
have them installed on your system.

You must unpack mupdf-thirdparty.zip to build using the Visual Studio project.

DOWNLOAD

The latest development source is available directly from the git repository:

	git clone http://mupdf.com/repos/mupdf.git

INSTALLING

Typing "make prefix=/usr/local install" will install the binaries, man-pages,
static libraries and header files on your system.
