README for the Fitz distribution.

Fitz is a graphics library.
MuPDF is a PDF parsing library and viewer.
For Windows, there is also a Mozilla plugin version of the viewer.

The Viewer has two ports: X11 and Windows.

PREREQUISITES

Before compiling Fitz you need to install thirdy party dependencies.

	zlib
	libjpeg
	freetype2

There are a few optional dependencies that you don't strictly need.
You will probably want the versions that Ghostscript maintains.

	jbig2dec
	jasper

Fitz uses the Perforce Jam build tool. You need the Perforce version 2.5
or later. FTJam will also work. If you do not have a compiled
binary for your system, you can find the Jam and FTJam web sites here:

	http://www.perforce.com/jam/jam.html
	http://www.freetype.org/jam/index.html

I use Mingw and MSYS to compile for Windows. If you use anything
else, you are on your own.

COMPILING

If all of that is installed, compiling should be a cinch.
Issue the command 'jam' in the root of the Fitz directory.
Add a parameter '-sBUILD=release' or '-sBUILD=profile' to
build release or profile versions.

	$ jam '-sBUILD=release'

If the build fails because it cannot find header files or libraries,
look first in Jamrules to see if there is anything wrong with the
search paths or compiler flags for your system.

To compile in the optional jbig2 and jpeg2000 support, you need
to add the following arguments to jam:

	$ jam '-sHAVE_JBIG2DEC=yes' '-sHAVE_JASPER=yes'

To build the X11 version under MacOS X, add:

	$ jam '-sHAVE_X11=yes'

If you want a crippled version without the builtin CJK fonts and data files,
to shave a few megabytes off the binary size, add:

	$ jam '-sDEFINES=NOCJK'

INSTALLING

There is no install. Just copy the resulting binary from the build
directory to a directory in your path.
