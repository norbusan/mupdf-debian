	fz_display_list is a list containing drawing commands (text,
	images, etc.). The intent is two-fold: as a caching-mechanism
	to reduce parsing of a page, and to be used as a data
	structure in multi-threading where one thread parses the page
	and another renders pages.

	Create a displaylist with fz_new_display_list, hand it over to
	fz_new_list_device to have it populated, and later replay the
	list (once or many times) by calling fz_run_display_list. When
	the list is no longer needed drop it with fz_drop_display_list.

	for example scaling and rotation, see fz_scale, fz_rotate and
	fz_concat. Set to fz_identity if no transformation is desired.

	visible within this area will be considered when the list is
	run through the device. This does not imply for tile objects
	contained in the display list.

	running the page. Intended for multi-threaded applications,
	while single-threaded applications set cookie to NULL. The
	caller may abort an ongoing page run. Cookie also communicates
	progress information back to the caller. The fields inside
	cookie are continually updated while the page is being run.
