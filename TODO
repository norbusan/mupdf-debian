immediate plan:
	- refcount resources
	- put image load/scale into rastfuncs
	- altivec optimize
	- gtk+pdf
	- page labels + dests + outline + annots
	- global font/cmap cache
	- design gui for editor
	- talk to keithp about fontconfig cid-font + cmap support
	- go through spec and check all features!
	- font and cmap config (where to load cmap and which cid fonts)

---

colorspace conversions (v2)
	- fast color cubes
	- proper colorspace conversions
	- gamut compression
	- extended render intents

image rendering (v2)
	- tiles
	- dct case
	- better filter than box
	- lazy decoding

shadings
	- ... jeong ...

rendering
	- fix glyphcache evictlast
	- bbox culling per glyph
	- optimize image load/decode/scale
	- cpu-specific optims
	- font focus

parser
	- image color key transparency
	- rewrite 1x1 images as fillrect
	- try to clean up colorspace/material handling in interpreter
	- annotations and destinations (for links and outline)

fz_optimizetree()
	- concatenate chained transforms
	- remove identity transforms

clean up
	- reference count everything
	- design by contract
	- split into private and public
	- comments and documentation

cache
	global cache for cmaps and fontfiles (emb+sys)
	render cache (link-nodes and scaled images and shades)
